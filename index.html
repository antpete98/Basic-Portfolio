           <p> My name is Anthony, Im a 19 year old student from North Dallas.
            Orginally from Oklahoma, I moved to the DFW area in 2003. Ive lived all over from Keller,
        to plano. I enjoy hobbies like golfing and recreational basketball. Im also in the competative
    gaming scene (ps4). I graduated Highschool in 2017. That summer i made the decision to take a break and do some
    independent research involving mythology/egyptology and ancient mesopotamia.
